Y HELO THAR!!!1!

    This version of lolcode supports nearly all of the functionality described
    in the LOLCODE 1.2 specification.  For more information, see
    < http://lolcode.com/specs/1.2 >.

    To get started, just run ``make'' in this directory.  This will generate a
    binary file called ``lolcode''.

    If you just run the binary file (``./lolcode'') you'll notice that it just
    hangs at the prompt -- that's because it's in interpreter mode, waiting for
    you to start typing!

    lolcode can interpret files from standard input or from a file.  For
    example, running ``./lolcode -f file.lol'' will interpret the LOLCODE file
    ``file.lol''.  You can also pipe output to lolcode, as in ``cat file.lol |
    ./lolcode'' if this suits your need.

    If you really want to get fancy, you can make a script file that gets
    interpreted whenever it is run.  The first line of the script should be
    ``#!/path/to/lolcode'' (of course, replacing ``/path/to'' with the actual
    path).  After that, code away in LOLCODE.  When you're ready to run the file
    as a script, be sure to do a ``chmod +x file.lol'' and then you're all set
    to ``./file.lol'' and it will be interpreted just like any old script.

TODO

    There are still a lot of TODO items, but I've released the source with the
    intent that others will use the lolcode interpreter as I continue to refine
    its behavior.

    The following features of the 1.2 specification still need implementation:

      - Unicode support.

    If you really miss either of these, feel free to hack away at the source
    and contribute to the project!
